PROJECT OVERVIEW:

The goal of this study is to determine the biological trend between mutations in the TCGA,
PanCancer Atlas data set and the average age of patients diagnosed with Bladder Urothelial Carcinoma (UCC).
The correlation of biological mutations and average patient age is important in order to understand whether the risk
of developing cancer increases after a certain age. This can be particularly useful for clinicians as they can use
genetic testing to determine the risk that an individual may have of developing cancer at the later stages of life. This analysis was conducted through a 5-step procedure as follows
1. Data visualisation
2. Differential Expression
3. PCA
4. Clustering
5. Survival analysis

Note: The rmd code files along with the rendered HTML for each of these aspects of the data pipeline are attached in the FinalProject folder.

Challenges:
Initially our team aimed to perform linear regression analysis. However there was no strong corelations related to patient age and for this reason this method was not taken.
Instead we have chosen to analyse the most strongly expressed genes over and uner 65 years of age through differential analysis. Using this method, the upregulated and downregulated
genes were isolated and plotted using a volcano plot. Furthermore, heatmaps were additionally created to visualise the difference between the data.

Group Contribution Summary:
As discussed with the professor, our team has been facing challenges with regards to task distribution as 2 of our group members have been unwell under the duration of the final
project. The task distribution can be viewed as follows:
Code:
1. Data visualisation - RHEA KAUL
2. Differential Expression - ANJALI MENON
3. PCA - ANJALI MENON
4. Clustering - ANJALI MENON
5. Survival analysis RHEA KAUL
